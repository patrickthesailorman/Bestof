______
Tried to create a simple and easy to use app that would appeal to a large audience. The basic functionality and style is in place with room to grow. I would expect the categories to grow and addittional pages to be added as the posts grow. Then I would add a search feature capable of finding keywords in posts by category. Eventually I would like to see users (and local businesses) create more eloborate profiles and have the ability to comment on posts.
_______
I would also like to add profile pictures and an image uploader. for now it's just urls. It works but something to improve on....
